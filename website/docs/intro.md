# Introduction

The Logion SDK enables the creation of Typescript applications that interact with a Logion network.

In order to interact with a Logion network, a [client should be instantiated](./client/introduction.md).
The access to private data and transaction signature require a signer, either
[embedded](./client/authentication.md) or using a [browser extension](/docs/category/extension).

For a more business-oriented description of Logion, please refer to our [white paper](https://docs.logion.network/logion-white-paper).
In particular, [this page](https://docs.logion.network/logion-white-paper/logion-in-a-nutshell) summarizes
Logion's process.
