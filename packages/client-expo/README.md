# Logion Client SDK (Expo)

This project provides a JS/TypeScript SDK enabling an [Expo](https://expo.dev)
application to interact with a logion network.

## Installation

Use your favorite package manager (e.g. yarn) and add `@logion/client` and `@logion/client-expo` packages to your project.
you will also need to install some peer dependencies: `buffer`, `expo-file-system` and `expo-crypto`.

You may have to setup `buffer` by adding the following line as soon as possible in your code:

```js
global.Buffer = Buffer;
```

## Usage

See [documentation](https://logion-network.github.io/logion-api/).
