# Logion Crossmint SDK

This project provides some utility classes enabling the use of the
[Crossmint wallet](https://github.com/Crossmint/embed)
with the [logion client](https://github.com/logion-network/logion-api/tree/main/packages/client#readme).

Note that only message signature is supported. So you will be able to authenticate and interact
with logion off-chain services, but not submit extrinsics to the logion chain.

## Usage

See [documentation](https://logion-network.github.io/logion-api/).
